# SeleniumTesting
First, I made a new github repo, and a fresh Maven project in intelliJ. Next I searched google for "Selenium setup Java", which brought me here: http://seleniumsimplified.com/get-started/ . Next, I downloaded the chrome webDriver and added the selenium dependancies to the pom.xml file.
